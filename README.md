# Delight

Delight is a node-based tool for making complex lighting animations on Razer Chroma-enabled devices.

## Installation & launch

Just use `npm install` and `npm start`. Note that because this project hasn't been actively worked on for over a year,
the dependencies are a bit old, so check the console messages for any and all missing software required by included libraries.

Delight requires Razer Synapse 3 to display the effects on real hardware, but the built-in preview can be used in absence of a physical Razer keyboard.
